# Revamped-Smart-City

It is a revamped version of my repository- 'Smart City'. Some key differences are- In the Smart City (which I have created in my third semester), I have used HTML, CSS, JS and PHP. But in this version I have used Bootstrap, HTML, CSS for frontend. Deployed it in a django framework and backend used is Firebase.
